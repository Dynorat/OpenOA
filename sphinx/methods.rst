Analysis Methods
======================

Analysis Methods are a collection of modules and classes to accomplish high level analysis of plant data. They integrate
the more abstract toolkit modules with specific PlantData classes to create a reproducible process. Analysis modules may
respect the engine parameter of PlantData objects to support multi-platform, scalable analysis.
